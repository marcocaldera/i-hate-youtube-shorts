# I Hate YouTube Shorts

A Safari extension that automatically redirects away from YouTube Shorts to the main YouTube homepage.

## Features

- Automatically detects when you're on a YouTube Shorts URL
- Immediately redirects you to the main YouTube homepage
- Works on YouTube in Safari
- No configuration needed - just install and enjoy a Shorts-free YouTube experience

## How It Works

This extension uses a simple content script that:
1. Detects when you land on a YouTube URL containing "/shorts/"
2. Automatically redirects you to the YouTube homepage
3. Continuously monitors for URL changes to prevent Shorts from loading

## Development

This project is built as a Safari Web Extension using Xcode. To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run the project
4. Enable the extension in Safari
